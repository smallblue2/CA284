## Systems Programming (CA284)
This repository was a self-exercise in git.
My final grade in this course was 94%.

## Learning Outcomes from this course
This course was an introduction to C, and my first exploration into memory management and more.

Through the learning of this course, I was able to;

1. Apply problem-solving tecniques to writing well-structured programs in the C programming language.
2. Recognise the relationship between programs expressed in C and in assembly code, including the implementation of expressions, control, procedures, and data structures.
3. Demonstrate ability to understand basic intention of a program through its binary representation and apply these skills to debugging programs.
4. Investigate the programmerâ€™s interaction with the underlying system through the different APIs and abstractions.
5. Analyse the consequences of imperfect system usage, such as poor memory and CPU performance, crashes, and security vulnerabilities.
6. Apply analytical abilities to create reliable and efficient programs exercising the different components of a modern computing system.
